### ðŸŽ¤ Elevator Pitch  
Hi, my name is Antonio Jones. Iâ€™m a former Air Force Office of Special Investigations Special Agent with experience conducting digital investigations and securing sensitive information. My professional background includes server-side administration, system analysis, and incident response, which gives me a strong foundation for a cybersecurity role. I recently completed the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate and am actively pursuing my CompTIA Security+ certification.

I'm particularly excited about the Systems Engineer role at Palo Alto Networks because it aligns with my goal of applying my investigative mindset and technical experience to protect digital systems. The work feels like a natural transition from physical investigations to securing digital environments.

In my most recent role, I supported systems infrastructure in VMware and Azure environments, created PowerShell automation scripts, and implemented patch management and security compliance alongside InfoSec. Iâ€™m confident these skills translate directly to identifying and mitigating threats in a real-time environment.

Palo Alto Networksâ€™ mission to protect the digital way of life deeply resonates with me. I admire the companyâ€™s commitment to innovation and inclusion and would be proud to contribute to a team thatâ€™s reshaping the future of cybersecurity.
