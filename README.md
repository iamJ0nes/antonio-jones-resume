🗣️ Elevator Pitch
Here’s my quick introduction for hiring managers, recruiters, and networking opportunities:

Hello, my name is Antonio Jones. I recently transitioned into cybersecurity after completing the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate, building on a strong background in system administration, cloud platforms, and incident response. My prior experience spans roles at Analog Devices, Salesforce, and the United States Air Force Office of Special Investigations, where I developed a keen eye for protecting critical systems and data.

I’m passionate about cybersecurity because it mirrors the investigation work I loved in the Air Force, but focuses on defending data and systems instead of physical assets. I bring strengths in cloud systems, access control, server environments, and am currently pursuing CompTIA Security+ to expand my capabilities even further.

I’m especially excited by mission-driven companies like Palo Alto Networks because of their leadership in cybersecurity and commitment to protecting digital life.
